Latest Tweets
=============

"Latest Tweets" is a sleek module by JoomlaWorks which can be used to fetch your Twitter statuses on your Joomla! website, the easy way and real-time.

Just set your parameters and publish the module. You can even copy the module to multiple instances and fetch the latest tweets from different users on your website (e.g. in a multi-author environment).

Unlike other related modules, this one does not require that you create a Twitter app for your site (a quite tedious process). Instead it uses 2 "proxy" services which provide a public API to Twitter's now walled garden of APIs.

The module is released under the GNU/GPL v2 license.
